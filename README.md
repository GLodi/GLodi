## Hi there, nice to meet you ðŸ‘‹


I'm Giulio Lodi! I'm a Software Engineer and Computer Science Graduate at Universita' degli Studi di Milano. 

I'm working at [Artea](https://www.artea.com/), mainly on distributed indexing clusters for [Marelli](https://www.marelli.com)'s Big Data needs.

At the same time I'm graduating with a **Master Thesis** on **Distributed, Highly-Scalable Streaming Engines for Real-Time Anomaly Detection**. My goal is to design a scalable architecture to deploy ML models and detect anomalies in [Marelli](https://www.marelli.com)'s manufacturing lines.


My studies are focused on **Distributed Systems** and **Big Data**. I've also spent my uni years developing **Mobile Apps**, mostly Android and Flutter. Check out some of my apps below!

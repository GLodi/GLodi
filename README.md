## Hi there, nice to meet you ðŸ‘‹


I'm Giulio Lodi and I'm a Computer Science Graduate at Universita' degli Studi di Milano. 

I'm graduating with a **Master Thesis** about **Distributed, Highly-Scalable Streaming Engines for Real-time Anomaly Detection**. My goal is to design a scalable architecture to deploy ML models and detect anomalies in [Marelli](https://www.marelli.com)'s manufacturing lines.


My studies are focused on **Distributed Systems** and **Big Data**. I've also spent my uni years studying and developing **mobile apps**, mostly Android and Flutter. Check out some of my apps below!
